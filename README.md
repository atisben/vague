# bastack

Personal AI-powered development workflow. Twelve slash commands that cover the full software development lifecycle — from idea to retro.

## Quickstart

```bash
./install.sh
```

Then in Claude Code or GitHub Copilot CLI, use any slash command.

## Skill Map

### Planning
| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/office-hours` | You have an idea. Validates it, challenges it, writes a design doc. |
| `/plan-ceo-review` | Pressure-test scope. Expand, hold, or reduce. |
| `/plan-eng-review` | Lock in architecture, data model, test strategy. |

### Design
| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/design-consultation` | New project UI — creates `DESIGN.md` from scratch. |
| `/design-shotgun` | Visual brainstorm — generate 3 variants, pick one. |
| `/design-html` | Turn an approved design into production HTML/CSS. |
| `/design-review` | Visual QA on a live site — find and fix issues. |

### Execution
| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ship` | Implement, test, commit, push, PR. |
| `/review` | Pre-landing code review before merging. |
| `/investigate` | Debug systematically — root cause first. |

### Reflection
| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/learn` | Browse, search, prune, and export project learnings. |
| `/retro` | Weekly engineering retrospective. |

## Workflow

```
Idea
  └─ /office-hours          → design doc
      ├─ /plan-ceo-review   → scope decisions
      └─ /plan-eng-review   → architecture locked

      ┌─ /design-consultation  → DESIGN.md
      ├─ /design-shotgun       → pick a layout
      └─ /design-html          → production HTML

          └─ /ship         → implement + PR
              └─ /review   → pre-landing review
                              └─ merge

                              /investigate   (when bugs happen)
                              /learn         (anytime)
                              /retro         (end of week)
```

## Config

```bash
bs-config set proactive true    # auto-suggest skills
bs-config set proactive false   # only explicit /commands
bs-config set telemetry local   # log locally
bs-config set telemetry off     # no logging
bs-config list                  # show all config
```
